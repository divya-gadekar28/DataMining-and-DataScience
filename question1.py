#Write a programme in python to apply simple linear regression and find out mean absolute error, mean squared error and root mean squared error

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np  # NumPy is a library for numerical operations in Python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  # Linear Regression model from scikit-learn
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error  # Metrics for model evaluation

# Create input features (X) and target variable (y) as NumPy arrays
X = np.array([2.5, 5.1, 3.2, 8.5, 3.5]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape to a column vector
y = np.array([21, 47, 27, 75, 30])

# Create a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train (fit) the Linear Regression model on the provided data
model.fit(X, y)   # This is where the model "learns" from the data

# Use the trained model to make predictions on the input features (X)
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y, y_pred)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)

# Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

# Print the evaluation metrics
print("Mean Absolute Error: ", mae)
print("Mean Squared Error: ", mse)
print("Root Mean Squared Error: ", rmse)


# Linear Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (also called the dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables).
